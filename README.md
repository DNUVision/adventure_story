A Python Adventure Story game

This is an adventure game project written in Python.
The game is played through the Terminal using the keyboard.
This is my first project and it is based on the book "Make Your Own Python Text Adventure: A Guide to Learning Programming" By Phillip Johnson, 2018.

You can purchase the book through Amazon"# adventure_story"
